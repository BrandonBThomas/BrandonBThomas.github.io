# About Me
## My Interests
For the past four years I have been a competitive Ninja Warrior competitor. In those years I went from not knowing how to do a simple move to competing in **Pro** level competitions. Some of my most notable competitions have been; 
 * Ultimate Ninja Assosiation World Finals Season 6-7
 * National Ninja League Season 6
 While I only competed as a _pro_ for one of those competitions, all of these have been my **_World Finals_** apperances.
Those competitions gave me the confidence I needed to apply for _American Ninja Warrior Season 15_. To my suprise, I got invited to compete on the show that year. Even though it was my rookie season I made it past the [Qualifiers,]() hit a buzzer in the [Semi Finals,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eeLDH7_j-o t=8m12s) and finally ended my season in Las Vegas on [Stage One of the National Finals]()

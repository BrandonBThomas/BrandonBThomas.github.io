#About Me

##My Interests
For the past four years I have been a competitive Ninja Warrior competitor. In those years I went from not knowing how to do a simple move to competing in _pro_ level competitions. Some of my most notable competitions have been;

* Ultimate Ninja Assosiation World Finals Season 6-7
* National Ninja League Season 6 

While I only competed as a pro for one of those competitions, all of these have been my **_World Finals apperances_**. Those competitions gave me the confidence I needed to apply for _American Ninja Warrior Season 15_. To my suprise, I got invited to compete on the show that year. Even though it was my rookie season I made it past the **_Qualifiers_**, hit a buzzer in the **_Semi Finals_**, my season did eventually end in Las Vegas on Stage One of the **_National Finals_**.
